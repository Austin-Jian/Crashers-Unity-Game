**ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This project is a rough prototype for the company NOODLE GAMES. Crashers is an endless runner game similar to crossyroad but with modifications.
The project was developed using the Unity Game Engine and all scripts were written in C#. To create the illusion of infinitely generating platforms, 
the concept of procedural generation was used. The game allows you to play between 14 different characters, offering variety and making the game more 
enjoyable.

the app store. We also plan on changing more features of the game to add more originality.
